# MSTL Models Benchmark

Comprehensive benchmark comparing Anofox and Statsforecast implementations of MSTL (Multiple Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess) forecasting models on M5 Competition dataset.

## Latest Results

**M5 Daily Dataset** (42,840 series, horizon=28, seasonality=7):

Results will be populated after running benchmarks.

## Evaluation Metrics

**MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error)** - Primary metric:
```
MASE = MAE / naive_baseline_error

Where:
- MAE = mean(|y_true - y_pred|)
- naive_baseline_error = mean(|y_train[t] - y_train[t-seasonality]|)

MASE < 1.0 = Better than naive seasonal baseline
MASE = 1.0 = Equal to naive seasonal baseline
MASE > 1.0 = Worse than naive seasonal baseline
```

**MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**:
```
MAE = mean(|y_true - y_pred|)
```

**RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**:
```
RMSE = sqrt(mean((y_true - y_pred)²))
```
- Penalizes larger errors more heavily than MAE

All metrics calculated:
1. Per individual time series
2. Averaged across all series for aggregate performance
