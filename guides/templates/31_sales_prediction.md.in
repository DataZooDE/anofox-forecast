## Summary

**Revenue Forecasting Best Practices**:
1. ✅ Prepare data carefully (30-50% accuracy improvement)
2. ✅ Use confidence intervals for risk management
3. ✅ Aggregate forecasts to business reporting periods (monthly, quarterly)
4. ✅ Track forecast vs actual continuously
5. ✅ Generate multiple scenarios (best/worst/expected)
6. ✅ Provide actionable recommendations
7. ✅ Integrate with existing business systems

**KPIs to Monitor**:
- Forecast accuracy (MAPE < 20% is good)
- Forecast bias (should be near 0)
- Interval coverage (should match confidence level)
- Revenue at risk (downside scenario)
- Attainment vs targets
