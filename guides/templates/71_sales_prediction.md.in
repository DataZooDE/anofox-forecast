# Sales Prediction & Revenue Forecasting - Business Guide

> **📝 Note**: This guide presents simplified workflows to demonstrate forecasting concepts. Real-world sales forecasting is significantly more complex and requires:
> - Deep understanding of sales cycles and market dynamics
> - Integration with CRM and sales pipeline data
> - Consideration of marketing campaigns, seasonality, and economic factors
> - Validation against actual business outcomes
> - Continuous model refinement based on performance
>
> Use these examples as starting points, not production-ready solutions.

## Business Context

**Objective**: Predict future sales and revenue for:
- Financial planning and budgeting

- Strategic decision-making

## Key Business Questions

1. **"What will our revenue be next quarter?"**
2. **"Which products will drive growth?"**
3. **"Are we on track to meet targets?"**
4. **"What's the risk range for our projections?"**

## Summary

**Revenue Forecasting Best Practices**:
1. ✅ Prepare data carefully (30-50% accuracy improvement)
2. ✅ Use confidence intervals for risk management
3. ✅ Aggregate forecasts to business reporting periods (monthly, quarterly)
4. ✅ Track forecast vs actual continuously
5. ✅ Generate multiple scenarios (best/worst/expected)
6. ✅ Provide actionable recommendations
7. ✅ Integrate with existing business systems

**KPIs to Monitor**:
- Forecast accuracy (MAPE < 20% is good)
- Forecast bias (should be near 0)
- Interval coverage (should match confidence level)
- Revenue at risk (downside scenario)
- Attainment vs targets
