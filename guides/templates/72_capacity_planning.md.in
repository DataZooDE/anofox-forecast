# Capacity Planning & Resource Optimization - Business Guide

> **📝 Note**: This guide presents simplified workflows to demonstrate forecasting concepts. Real-world capacity planning is significantly more complex and requires:
> - Detailed understanding of operational constraints and costs
> - Integration with workforce management and scheduling systems
> - Consideration of service level agreements and quality metrics
> - Scenario analysis and contingency planning
> - Balance between cost optimization and service quality
>
> Use these examples as starting points, not production-ready solutions.

## Business Context

**Challenge**: Allocate resources efficiently to meet demand without over-provisioning.

**Areas**:
- Workforce planning
- Equipment/machinery utilization
- Server capacity (IT)
- Manufacturing capacity
- Warehouse space

**Goal**: Match capacity to forecasted demand while minimizing costs.

## Summary

**Capacity Planning Workflow**:
1. ✅ Forecast demand using appropriate model
2. ✅ Calculate resource requirements from demand
3. ✅ Use confidence intervals for buffer sizing
4. ✅ Optimize for cost (balance over/under capacity)
5. ✅ Monitor actual vs plan continuously
6. ✅ Adjust capacity dynamically

**Key Formulas**:
- **Staff needed** = CEIL(Demand × Processing_time / (Hours_per_shift × Occupancy_target))
- **Safety buffer** = Upper_CI - Expected
- **Utilization target** = 75-85% (allows flexibility)
- **Safety stock** = Z_score × √Lead_time × Demand_std

**Business Impact**:
- 20-30% reduction in capacity costs
- 40-60% reduction in stockouts/service failures
- 15-25% improvement in resource utilization
- Better workforce planning and morale

**Pro Tip**: Always plan for 95th percentile demand, not average! This ensures you can handle peak loads while minimizing over-provisioning.
