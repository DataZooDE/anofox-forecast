# Demand Forecasting for Retail & Inventory - Business Guide

> **📝 Note**: This guide presents simplified workflows to demonstrate forecasting concepts. Real-world demand forecasting is significantly more complex and requires:
> - Domain expertise in retail/inventory management
> - Careful validation and testing
> - Business rules integration (promotions, seasonality, external factors)
> - Continuous monitoring and adjustment
> - Collaboration with business stakeholders
>
> Use these examples as starting points, not production-ready solutions.

## Business Problem

**Challenge**: Optimize inventory levels to:
- Minimize stockouts (lost sales)
- Minimize excess inventory (holding costs)
- Improve cash flow
- Enhance customer satisfaction

**Solution**: Accurate demand forecasting

## Business Value

### ROI Example

**Before Forecasting**:
- Stockout rate: 15%
- Excess inventory: 25%
- Lost sales: $500K/year
- Holding costs: $200K/year
- **Total cost**: $700K/year

**After Forecasting (85% accuracy)**:
- Stockout rate: 5%
- Excess inventory: 10%
- Lost sales: $150K/year
- Holding costs: $80K/year
- **Total cost**: $230K/year
- **Savings**: $470K/year (67% reduction)

- **Bias**: Target near 0 (no systematic over/under forecast)

### Financial Metrics
- **Holding Cost Reduction**: Target 30-40%
- **Stockout Cost Reduction**: Target 50-70%
- **Cash Flow Improvement**: Track working capital
- **ROI**: Typical 5-10x in first year
