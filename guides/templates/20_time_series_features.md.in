## Basic Usage

### Simple Feature Extraction

Compute all default features for a time series:

<!-- include: test/sql/docs_examples/20_ts_features_basic_01.sql -->

The output is a STRUCT containing all available features. Use struct expansion (`feats.*`) to access all features as individual columns. If you only need specific features, explicitly specify them in the `feature_selection` parameter:

```sql
-- Extract only specific features
SELECT feats.*
FROM (
    SELECT ts_features(ts, value, ['mean', 'variance', 'length']) AS feats
    FROM sample_ts
);
```

### Listing Available Features

Use `ts_features_list()` to explore available features and their parameters:

<!-- include: test/sql/docs_examples/20_ts_features_list_02.sql -->

**Output Columns**:
- `column_name`: Full column name (includes parameter suffixes)
- `feature_name`: Base feature name
- `parameter_suffix`: Parameter suffix (e.g., `__lag_1`, `__r_2`)
- `default_parameters`: Default parameter values as JSON string
- `parameter_keys`: Available parameter keys for this feature

## Feature Selection

### Select Specific Features

Limit computation to specific features for better performance:

<!-- include: test/sql/docs_examples/20_ts_features_selection_03.sql -->

### Multiple Features

Select multiple features at once:

```sql
SELECT 
    product_id,
    feats.*
FROM (
    SELECT 
        product_id,
        ts_features(
            ts,
            value,
            ['mean', 'variance', 'autocorrelation__lag_1', 'sum_values']
        ) AS feats
    FROM sales_data
    GROUP BY product_id
)
ORDER BY product_id;
```

---

## Parameter Customization

### Inline Parameter Overrides

Many features accept parameters. Override defaults using the `feature_params` argument:

<!-- include: test/sql/docs_examples/20_ts_features_params_04.sql -->

**Parameter Format**: `LIST(STRUCT(feature VARCHAR, params MAP(VARCHAR, ANY)))`

### Parameterized Feature Columns

When you specify parameters, the output column names include parameter suffixes:

```sql
-- Without parameters: column name is 'ratio_beyond_r_sigma'
-- With r=1.0: column name is 'ratio_beyond_r_sigma__r_1'
-- With r=2.0: column name is 'ratio_beyond_r_sigma__r_2'
```

### Multiple Parameter Variants

Compute the same feature with different parameters:

```sql
SELECT feats.*
FROM (
    SELECT ts_features(
        ts,
        value,
        ['autocorrelation'],
        [
            {'feature': 'autocorrelation', 'params': {'lag': 1}},
            {'feature': 'autocorrelation', 'params': {'lag': 3}},
            {'feature': 'autocorrelation', 'params': {'lag': 6}}
        ]
    ) AS feats
    FROM time_series_data
);
```

This produces columns: `autocorrelation__lag_1`, `autocorrelation__lag_3`, `autocorrelation__lag_6`.

## Configuration Files

### JSON Configuration

Load feature configuration from a JSON file:

<!-- include: test/sql/docs_examples/20_ts_features_json_config_05.sql -->

**JSON Format**:
```json
[
    {
        "feature": "autocorrelation",
        "params": {"lag": 2}
    },
    {
        "feature": "ratio_beyond_r_sigma",
        "params": {"r": 1.5}
    }
]
```

### CSV Configuration

Load configuration from CSV (table-friendly format):

<!-- include: test/sql/docs_examples/20_ts_features_csv_config_06.sql -->

**CSV Format**:
```csv
feature,lag,r
autocorrelation,2,
ratio_beyond_r_sigma,,1.5
```

The CSV format uses column headers where:
- `feature` column is required
- Other columns map to parameter names (e.g., `lag`, `r`, `window`)
- Empty cells are treated as NULL (use defaults)

### Configuration Template

Generate a template configuration file:

```sql
SELECT feature, params_json
FROM ts_features_config_template()
ORDER BY feature;
```

Use this to create your own configuration files.

## Rolling Window Features

### Basic Rolling Window

Compute features over a rolling window using SQL window functions:

<!-- include: test/sql/docs_examples/20_ts_features_rolling_07.sql -->

**Key Points**:
- Use `OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ... ROWS BETWEEN ...)`
- Window frame defines the rolling window size
- Features are computed on the data within each window frame
- Some features require minimum sample sizes (may return NULL for small windows)

### Common Window Patterns

**Fixed-size rolling window** (e.g., last 7 days):
```sql
SELECT 
    date,
    value,
    (ts_features(date, value, ['mean']) OVER (
        PARTITION BY series_id 
        ORDER BY date
        ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    )).mean AS rolling_7day_mean
FROM time_series_data;
```

**Expanding window** (all data up to current row):
```sql
SELECT 
    date,
    value,
    (ts_features(date, value, ['variance']) OVER (
        PARTITION BY series_id 
        ORDER BY date
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    )).variance AS expanding_variance
FROM time_series_data;
```

**Centered window** (e.g., ±3 days around current row):
```sql
SELECT 
    date,
    value,
    (ts_features(date, value, ['mean']) OVER (
        PARTITION BY series_id 
        ORDER BY date
        ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND 3 FOLLOWING
    )).mean AS centered_mean
FROM time_series_data;
```

### Multiple Rolling Features

Compute multiple features in the same rolling window:

<!-- include: test/sql/docs_examples/20_ts_features_rolling_multi_08.sql -->

### Rolling Features with Parameters

Combine rolling windows with parameter overrides:

```sql
SELECT 
    date,
    value,
    (ts_features(
        date,
        value,
        ['autocorrelation'],
        [{'feature': 'autocorrelation', 'params': {'lag': 1}}]
    ) OVER (
        PARTITION BY series_id 
        ORDER BY date
        ROWS BETWEEN 10 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    )).autocorrelation__lag_1 AS rolling_autocorr
FROM time_series_data;
```

## Grouping and Aggregation

### GROUP BY Aggregation

Compute features per group (e.g., per product, per region):

<!-- include: test/sql/docs_examples/20_ts_features_groupby_09.sql -->

### Multiple Groups

Group by multiple columns:

```sql
SELECT 
    region,
    category,
    feats.*
FROM (
    SELECT 
        region,
        category,
        ts_features(ts, value, ['mean', 'variance']) AS feats
    FROM sales_data
    GROUP BY region, category
);
```

## Complete Examples

### Feature Engineering for ML

Extract features for machine learning pipelines:

<!-- include: test/sql/docs_examples/20_ts_features_ml_pipeline_10.sql -->

### Anomaly Detection

Use rolling features to detect anomalies:

```sql
WITH rolling_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        date,
        value,
        (ts_features(date, value, ['mean', 'variance']) OVER (
            PARTITION BY sensor_id 
            ORDER BY date
            ROWS BETWEEN 30 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        )) AS stats
    FROM sensor_data
)
SELECT 
    date,
    value,
    (stats).mean AS rolling_mean,
    (stats).variance AS rolling_variance,
    CASE 
        WHEN ABS(value - (stats).mean) > 3 * SQRT((stats).variance) 
        THEN 'ANOMALY' 
        ELSE 'NORMAL' 
    END AS anomaly_flag
FROM rolling_stats;
```

### Time Series Clustering

Extract feature vectors for clustering similar time series:

```sql
WITH feature_vectors AS (
    SELECT 
        series_id,
        ts_features(
            date,
            value,
            ['mean', 'variance', 'autocorrelation__lag_1', 'linear_trend']
        ) AS feats
    FROM time_series_data
    GROUP BY series_id
)
SELECT 
    series_id,
    feats.*
FROM feature_vectors
ORDER BY series_id;
```

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization

1. **Select only needed features**: Computing all features can be expensive
   ```sql
   -- Good: Select specific features
   SELECT feats.*
   FROM (
       SELECT ts_features(ts, value, ['mean', 'variance']) AS feats
       FROM your_table
   );
   
   -- Avoid: Computing all features unnecessarily
   SELECT feats.*
   FROM (
       SELECT ts_features(ts, value) AS feats
       FROM your_table
   );
   ```

2. **Use appropriate window sizes**: Larger windows = more computation
   ```sql
   -- Good: Reasonable window size
   ROWS BETWEEN 7 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
   
   -- Expensive: Very large windows
   ROWS BETWEEN 1000 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
   ```

3. **Pre-filter data**: Reduce data volume before feature extraction
   ```sql
   -- Good: Filter first
   SELECT feats.*
   FROM (
       SELECT ts_features(ts, value) AS feats
       FROM large_table 
       WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
       GROUP BY series_id
   );
   ```

### Feature Selection Tips

1. **Start with defaults**: Use `ts_features_list()` to explore available features
2. **Domain-specific features**: Choose features relevant to your use case
   - Trend detection: `linear_trend`, `mean_abs_change`
   - Seasonality: `autocorrelation`, `fft_coefficient`
   - Outliers: `ratio_beyond_r_sigma`, `max`, `min`
3. **Parameter tuning**: Experiment with different parameter values for parameterized features

### Handling NULL Values

- Features return NULL if insufficient data (e.g., `length` requires ≥2 samples)
- Some features may return NULL for certain input characteristics
- Always check for NULL before using features in downstream calculations

## Common Patterns

### Feature Comparison Across Series

```sql
WITH features AS (
    SELECT 
        series_id,
        ts_features(ts, value, ['mean', 'variance']) AS feats
    FROM time_series_data
    GROUP BY series_id
)
SELECT 
    series_id,
    feats.mean,
    feats.variance,
    feats.variance / NULLIF(feats.mean, 0) AS coefficient_of_variation
FROM features
ORDER BY coefficient_of_variation DESC;
```

### Rolling Feature Trends

Track how features change over time:

```sql
SELECT 
    date,
    value,
    (ts_features(date, value, ['mean', 'variance']) OVER (
        ORDER BY date
        ROWS BETWEEN 7 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    )) AS rolling_7day,
    (ts_features(date, value, ['mean', 'variance']) OVER (
        ORDER BY date
        ROWS BETWEEN 30 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    )) AS rolling_30day
FROM time_series_data;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "feature 'X' does not exist"

Use `ts_features_list()` to check available feature names:
```sql
SELECT column_name 
FROM ts_features_list() 
WHERE feature_name LIKE '%your_search%';
```

### Error: "feature 'X' specified more than once"

Remove duplicate feature names from your feature list.

### NULL Values in Features

- Check minimum sample requirements for features
- Verify window size is sufficient
- Some features may legitimately return NULL for certain data patterns

### Performance Issues

- Reduce feature count
- Use smaller window sizes
- Filter data before feature extraction
- Consider materializing intermediate results
